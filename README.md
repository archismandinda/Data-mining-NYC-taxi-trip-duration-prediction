# Data-mining-NYC-taxi-trip-duration-prediction
This dataset comes from Kaggle competition.

**Introduction**
In this data mining project, the goal of the problem is to predict New York City taxi trip duration, which is a supervised-learning regression problem. I will approach the problem in several steps, namely  exploratory data analysis, preprocessing phase, feature engineerings and xgboost modeling.

This project makes references to [his work](https://github.com/mxbi/mlnd-capstone).
